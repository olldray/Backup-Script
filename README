1. Description of project
-----------------
A rotating backup script for linux systems.

Essentially, it will make a specified number of daily backups. When the oldest backup falls on a 
specified day of the week, it will be moved to the weekly directory instead of being deleted. Likewise,
the oldest weekly backup will be moved to the monthly folder under specified circumstances. 

All backups are made by rsync with the --link-dest option, so that each backup directory contains
a full backup, but they only take up the disk space of a single copy (plus changes).

     30 2 * * * [path to]/rscript.pl &> [log file]
